# hfc-search

## Summary

Many aspects of the coding challenge called for retrieval based on the semantic intent of the search query -- while implementing basic heuristics would have been the "quick and dirty" method of completing the task I instead attempted to implement a true semantic retrieval mechanism through a series of experiments. Recent advancements in LLMs and embedding models has lowered the bar for implementing such a system.

My first attempt was to implement vector search using elasticsearch -- unfortunately semantic search is a feature primarily supported by the managed service, so this code can be disregarded.

The code found in this repo implments an in-memory cosine similarity search using OpenAI embeddings and Sqlite.

## Dependencies

- `docker`
- `docker-compose`
- `sqlite3`
- `make`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable

## Setup Data

- download test data into repo root

```bash
unzip DataEngCodeTest.zip
mv DataEngCodeTest site/backend/data
sqlite3 site/backend/sql_app.db "VACUUM;"
cd site/backend/
bash ../scripts/load-sql.sh
```

## Run

```bash
cd site/
docker compose up --build --remove-orphans
# OR
cd site/
make up
```

## Test

Since the embeddings are generated with each search, and stored in-memory, I have limited the user list to 50 entries. Future work includes storing the embeddings vectors in memory and using a production database like Qdrant.

`site/backend/app/routers/semantic_search.py`

```python
@router.post("/search/")
def search(query: str = "marketing", db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    logger.info("Performing semantic search")
    users = crud.get_all_users(db)[:50]
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/api/docs` and run the `/v1/semantic_search/search/` endpoint with the default query string.

Equivalent curl command:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://0.0.0.0:8000/v1/semantic_search/search/?query=marketing' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -d ''
```

The top five results are returned:
